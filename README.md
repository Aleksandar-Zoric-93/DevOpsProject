# Creating an Automated Pipeline 
Here I have a simple Android project which contains some basic unit tests.  Using this project,
a automated pipeline will be created via TeamCity and a few other technologies that will be mentioned in the commit messages.

What will be demonstrated is Continues Integration, Automated Testing and Continues Deployment.
